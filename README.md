# Ternary Search Tree Implementation

## Overview

This project implements a **Ternary Search Tree (TST)**, a type of trie-based data structure that efficiently supports search, insertion, and deletion operations. The project is developed in Python using an **object-oriented approach** to ensure modularity, clarity, and scalability. The implementation is tested for correctness and performance and is intended for use both in Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations and Python scripts for benchmarking on HPC infrastructure.
